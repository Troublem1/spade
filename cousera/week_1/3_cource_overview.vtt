00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.609
Hello and welcome to our course.

2
00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.610
In this video, I want to give you a sense for what this course is

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.805
about and I think the best way to do that is to talk about our course goals,

4
00:00:12.805 --> 00:00:15.965
our course assignments and our course schedule.

5
00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:17.505
So, at the broadest level,

6
00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:21.540
this course is about getting the required knowledge and expertise to

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.890
successfully participate in data science competitions. That's the goal.

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
Now, we're going to prepare this in a systematic way.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.975
We start in week one with a discussion of competitions,

10
00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:34.735
what are they, how they work,

11
00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:38.445
how they are different from real-life industrial data analysis.

12
00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:42.915
Then, we're moving to recap of main machine learning models.

13
00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:46.065
Besides this, we're going to review software and

14
00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:50.955
hardware requirements and common Python libraries for data analysis.

15
00:00:50.955 --> 00:00:52.362
After this is done,

16
00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:54.705
we'll go through various feature types,

17
00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:58.380
how we preprocess these features and generate new ones.

18
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.695
Now, because we sometimes need to extract features from text and images,

19
00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:06.565
we will elaborate on most popular methods to do it.

20
00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:10.850
Finally, we will start working on the final project, the competition.

21
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.070
But then we move on to week two.

22
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.075
So, having figured out methods to work with data frames and models,

23
00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:22.295
we're starting to cover things you first do in a competition.

24
00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:23.615
And this is, by the way,

25
00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:29.035
a great opportunity to start working on the final project as we proceed through material.

26
00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:30.825
So, first in this week,

27
00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:36.350
we'll analyze data set in the exploratory data analysis topic or EDA for short.

28
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.920
We'll discuss ways to build intuition about the data,

29
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.780
explore anonymized features and clean the data set.

30
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.050
Our main instrument here will be logic and visualizations.

31
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.160
Okay, now, after making EDA,

32
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.665
we switch to validation.

33
00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:55.357
And here, we'll spend some time talking about different validation strategies,

34
00:01:55.357 --> 00:01:59.597
identifying how data is split into train and test and

35
00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:01.900
about what problems we may encounter during

36
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.120
validation and ways to address those problems.

37
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.155
We finish this week with discussion of data leakage and leaderboard problem.

38
00:02:10.155 --> 00:02:14.175
We will define data leakage and understand what are leaks,

39
00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.900
how to discover various leaks and how to utilize them.

40
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.535
So basically, this week,

41
00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:23.040
we set up the main pipeline for our final project.

42
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.360
And at this point, you should have intuition about the data,

43
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.485
reliable validation and data leaks explored.

44
00:02:29.485 --> 00:02:32.120
After this pipeline is ready,

45
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.470
we'll focus on the improvement of our solution and that's already the week three.

46
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.170
In that week, we'll analyze various metrics for regression and

47
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.630
classification and figure out ways to

48
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.470
optimize them both while training the model and afterwards.

49
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.275
After we will check that we are correct in measure and improvements of our models,

50
00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:57.765
we'll define mean-encodings and work on the encoded features.

51
00:02:57.765 --> 00:03:00.463
So here, we start with categorical features,

52
00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:03.110
how mean-encoded features lead to overfitting

53
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.785
and how we balance overfitting with regularization.

54
00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:10.425
Then, we'll discuss several extensions to this approach

55
00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:15.101
including applying mean-encodings to numeric features and time series,

56
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:20.840
and this is the point where we move on to other advanced features in the week four.

57
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.340
Basically, this include statistics and distance-based features,

58
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.855
metrics factorizations, feature interactions and t-SNE.

59
00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:35.055
These features often are the key to superior performance in competition,

60
00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:39.880
so you should implement and optimize them here for the final project.

61
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.520
After this, we'll get to hyperparameters optimization.

62
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.110
Here, we will revise your knowledge about model tuning in

63
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.470
a systematic way and let you apply to the competition.

64
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.930
Then, we move onto the practical guide

65
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.275
where all of us have summarized most important moments

66
00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:03.645
about competitions which became absolutely clear after few years of participation.

67
00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:06.770
These include both some general advice on how to choose

68
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.250
and participate in the competition and some technical advice,

69
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.995
how to set up your pipeline,

70
00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:14.390
what to do first and so on.

71
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.920
Finally, we'll conclude this week by working on ensembles with KazAnova,

72
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.270
the Kaggle top one.

73
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.060
We'll start with simple linear ensemble,

74
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.346
then we continue with bagging and boosting,

75
00:04:25.346 --> 00:04:29.070
and finally we'll cover stacking and stacked net approach.

76
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.370
And here by the end of this week,

77
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.160
you should already have all required knowledge to succeed in a competition.

78
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.710
And then finally, we've got the last week.

79
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.205
Here we will work to analyze some of our winning solutions in competitions.

80
00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:47.110
But all we are really doing in the last week is wrapping up the course,

81
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.840
working on and submitting the final project.

82
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.295
So, this basic structure of this course.

83
00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:58.870
Now, we move through those sections so that you can practice your skills in

84
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.760
the course assignments and there are

85
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.490
three basic types of assignments in this class: quizzes,

86
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.310
programming assignments and the final project.

87
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.840
You don't have to do all of these in order to pass the class,

88
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.170
you only need to complete the required assignments and you can

89
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.110
see which ones those are by looking on the course website.

90
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.450
But let's go ahead and talk about the assignments.

91
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.075
We begin with the competition.

92
00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:27.105
This is going to be the main assignment for you.

93
00:05:27.105 --> 00:05:30.390
In fact, we start working on it on the week two.

94
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.890
There we do EDA, exploratory data analysis,

95
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.635
set up main pipeline that you'll use for

96
00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:39.485
the rest of the course and check the competition for leakages.

97
00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:42.770
Then in week three we update our solution by

98
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.900
optimizing given metric and adding mean-encoded features.

99
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.705
After that, in the week four,

100
00:05:48.705 --> 00:05:52.653
we further improve our solution by working on advanced features,

101
00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:56.570
tune your hyperparameters and uniting models in ensemble.

102
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.120
And in last week, we all are wrapping it up and

103
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.680
producing solution by Kaggle winning model standards.

104
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.910
We ask you to work on the project at

105
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.395
your local machine or your server because Coursera computational resources are limited,

106
00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:12.560
and using them for the final project can slow

107
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.445
down completing programming assignments for the fellow students.

108
00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:21.980
And, in fact, this class is mostly about this program and this competition assignment,

109
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.400
but we also have quizzes and programming assignments for you.

110
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.150
We include these to give you an opportunity to refine your knowledge about

111
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.320
specific parts of this course: how to check data for leakages,

112
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.270
how to implement mean encodings,

113
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.330
how to produce an ensemble and so on.

114
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.110
You can do them at Coursera site directly but you also can download

115
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.885
these notebooks and complete them at your local computer or your server.

116
00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:51.803
And this basically is an overview of the course goals,

117
00:06:51.803 --> 00:06:54.080
course schedule and course assignments.

118
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.350
So, let's go ahead and get started.
