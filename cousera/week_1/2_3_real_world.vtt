00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.680
In this video, I want to talk about complexity of

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.660
real world machine learning pipelines and how they differ from data science competitions.

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.720
Also, we will discuss the philosophy of the competitions.

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.710
Real world machine learning problems are very complicated.

5
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.145
They include several stages,

6
00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:22.275
each of them is very important and require attention.

7
00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.130
Let's imagine that we need to build an an anti-spam system and

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.530
consider the basic steps that arise when building such a system.

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.573
First of all, before doing any machine learning stuff,

10
00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.780
you need to understand the problem from a business point of view.

11
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.315
What do you want to do? For what?

12
00:00:37.315 --> 00:00:39.430
How can it help your users?

13
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.475
Next, you need to formalize the task.

14
00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.130
What is the definition of spam?

15
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.420
What exactly is to be predicted?

16
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.650
The next step is to collect data.

17
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.905
You should ask yourself,

18
00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:50.620
what data can we use?

19
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.705
How to mine examples of spam and non-spam?

20
00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:58.045
Next, you need to take care of how to clean your data and pre-process it.

21
00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:01.205
After that, you need to move on to building models.

22
00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:03.763
To do this, you need to answer the questions,

23
00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:07.135
which class of model is appropriate for this particular task?

24
00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:08.585
How to measure performance?

25
00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:10.930
How to select the best model?

26
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.660
The next steps are to check the effectiveness on the model in real scenario,

27
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.135
to make sure that it works as expected and

28
00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:20.000
there was no bias introduced by learning process.

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.775
Does the model actually block spam?

30
00:01:21.775 --> 00:01:24.380
How often does it block non-spam emails?

31
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.945
If everything is fine,

32
00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:28.295
then the next step is to deploy the model.

33
00:01:28.295 --> 00:01:29.717
Or in other words,

34
00:01:29.717 --> 00:01:31.490
make it available to users.

35
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.850
However, the process doesn't end here.

36
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.085
Your need to monitor the model performance and re-train it on new data.

37
00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:40.760
In addition, you need to periodically revise your understanding of

38
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.330
the problem and go for the cycle again and again.

39
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.945
In contrast, in competitions we have a much simpler situation.

40
00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:51.708
All things about formalization and evaluation are already done.

41
00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:54.805
All data collected and target metrics fixed.

42
00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:57.440
Therefore your mainly focus on pre-processing the data,

43
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.475
picking models and selecting the best ones.

44
00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:02.510
But, sometimes you need to understand

45
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.220
the business problem in order to get insights or generate a new feature.

46
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.075
Also sometimes organizers allow the usage of external data.

47
00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:15.725
In such cases, data collection become a crucial part of the solution.

48
00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:17.390
I want to show you the difference between

49
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.750
real life applications and competitions more thoroughly.

50
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.970
This table shows that competitions are much

51
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.190
simpler than real world machine learning problems.

52
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.005
The hardest part, problem formalization and choice of target metric, is already done.

53
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:33.920
Also questions related to deploying out of scope,

54
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.010
so participants can focus just on modeling part.

55
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.175
One may notice that in this table data collection and

56
00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:43.970
model complexity roles have no and yes in competition column.

57
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.345
The reason for that, that in some competitions you need to take care of these things.

58
00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:50.925
But usually it's not the case.

59
00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:53.296
I want to emphasize that as competitors,

60
00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:57.125
the only thing we should take care about is target metrics value.

61
00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:59.647
Speed, complexity and memory consumption,

62
00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:01.820
all this doesn't matter as long as you're able to

63
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.780
calculate it and re-produce your own results.

64
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.320
Let's highlight key points.

65
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.725
Real world machine learning pipelines are very complicated and consist of many stages.

66
00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:15.930
Competitions, add weight to a lot of things about modeling and data analysis,

67
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.270
but in general they don't address the questions of formalization, deployment and testing.

68
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.825
Now, I want to say a few words about philosophy on competitions,

69
00:03:24.825 --> 00:03:27.465
in order to form a right impression.

70
00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:32.585
We'll cover these ideas in more details later in the course along with examples.

71
00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:34.450
The first thing I want to show you is that,

72
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.203
machine learning competitions are not only about algorithms.

73
00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:39.800
An algorithm is just a tool.

74
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.825
Anybody can easily use it.

75
00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:43.460
You need something more to win.

76
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.080
Insights about data are usually much more useful than a returned ensemble.

77
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.445
Some competitions could be solved analytically,

78
00:03:50.445 --> 00:03:53.595
without any sophisticated machine learning techniques.

79
00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:57.238
In this course, we will show you the importance of understanding your data,

80
00:03:57.238 --> 00:04:02.015
tools to use and features you tried to exploit in order to produce the best solution.

81
00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:05.810
The next thing I want to say, don't limit yourself.

82
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.945
Keep in mind that the only thing you should care about is target metric.

83
00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:11.690
It's totally fine to use heuristics or

84
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.475
manual data analysis in order to construct golden feature and improve your model.

85
00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:20.105
Besides, don't be afraid of using complex solutions,

86
00:04:20.105 --> 00:04:24.560
advance feature engineering or doing the huge gritty calculation overnights.

87
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.200
Use all the ways you can find in order to improve your model.

88
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.410
After passing this course,

89
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.585
you will able to get the maximum gain from your data.

90
00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:34.703
And now the important aspect is creativity.

91
00:04:34.703 --> 00:04:39.150
You need to know traditional approaches of solid machine learning problems but,

92
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.780
you shouldn't be bounded by them.

93
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.060
It's okay to modify or hack existing algorithm for your particular task.

94
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.500
Don't be afraid to read source codes and change them,

95
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.240
especially for deploying stuff.

96
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.290
In our course, we'll show you examples of how a little bit of

97
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.210
creativity can lead to constructing

98
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.850
golden features or entire approaches for solving problems.

99
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.935
In the end, I want to say enjoy competitions.

100
00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:02.690
Don't be obsessed with getting money.

101
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.435
Experience and fun you get are much more valuables than the price.

102
00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:11.060
Also, networking is another great advantage of participating in data science competition.

103
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.190
I hope you find this course interesting.
