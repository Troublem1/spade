00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.390
And now, I want to introduce other lecturers of this course.

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.190
Alexander, Dmitry, Mikhail, and Marios.

3
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.520
Mikhail is aka Cassanova,

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.180
the person who reached the very top of competitive data science.

5
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.925
I will tell you a couple of thoughts about the origins of the course.

6
00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:27.660
In year 2014, we started our win in data science by joining competitions.

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.880
We've been meeting every week and discussing the past competitions, solutions,

8
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.885
ideas and tweaks what worked and what did not,

9
00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:36.760
this exchange of knowledge and experience helped us

10
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.915
to learn quickly from each other and improve our skills.

11
00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:41.680
Initially our community was small,

12
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.545
but over time more and more people were joining.

13
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:47.230
From the format of groups of discussion.

14
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.550
We moved on to the format of well organized meetings.

15
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.185
Where a speaker makes an overview of his approach and ideas in front of 50 people.

16
00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:56.585
These meetings are called machine learning trainings.

17
00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:00.110
Now with the help and support of Yandex and get a hundred of participants.

18
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.720
Thus we started from zero and learned everything by hard work and collaboration.

19
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240
We had an excellent teacher,

20
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.010
Alexander D'yakonov who was top one on Kaggle,

21
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.870
he took the course on critical data analysis.

22
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.235
In Moscow state university and there we're grateful to him.

23
00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:21.160
At some point we started to share our knowledge with

24
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.925
other people and some of us even started to read lectures at the university.

25
00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:31.630
So now we have decided to summarize everything and make it available for everyone.

26
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.835
Together. We've finished and procesed in about 20 different competitions

27
00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:40.585
only on Kaggle and just as many on other not so famous platforms.

28
00:01:40.585 --> 00:01:44.050
All of us have a tremendous amount of skill and experience in

29
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.250
competitive data science and now we want to share this experience with you.

30
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.500
For all of us,

31
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.555
competitive data science opened a number of opportunities

32
00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:56.745
as the competitions we took part were dedicated to a large variety of tasks.

33
00:01:56.745 --> 00:01:59.065
Mikhail works in e-commerce.

34
00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:02.140
Alexander builds predictive model for taxi services,

35
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.180
Dmitri works with financial data,

36
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.725
Mario develops machinery learning frameworks and I am a deep learning researcher.

37
00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:10.660
Competitions, without a doubt,

38
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.140
became a stepping stone for our careers and believe me,

39
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.040
good comparative record will bring success to you as well.

40
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.330
We hope you will find something interesting in this course and wish you good luck.
