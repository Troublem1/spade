00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.860
Hi everyone. We are starting course about machine learning competitions.

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.140
In this course, you will learn a lot of tricks

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.180
and best practices about data science competitions.

4
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.495
Before we start to learn advanced techniques,

5
00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:17.070
we need to understand the basics.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.710
In this video, I will explain the main concept of

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.155
competitions and you will become familiar with competition mechanics.

8
00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.085
A variety of machinery competition is very high.

9
00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.805
In some, participants are asked to process texts.

10
00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:32.110
In others, to classify picture or select the best advertising.

11
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.005
Despite the variety, all of these competitions are very similar in structure.

12
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.420
Usually, they consist of the same elements or

13
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.195
concepts which we will discuss in this video.

14
00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:44.150
Let's start with a data.

15
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.230
Data is what the organizers give us as training material.

16
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.065
We will use it in order to produce our solution.

17
00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:53.408
Data can be represented in a variety of formats.

18
00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:56.305
SSV file with several columns , a text file,

19
00:00:56.305 --> 00:00:57.645
an archive with pictures,

20
00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:01.815
a database dump, a disabled code or even all together.

21
00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:04.750
With the data, usually there is a description.

22
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.320
It's useful to read it in order to understand

23
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.930
what we'll work with and which feature can be extracted.

24
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.480
Here is an example from Kaggle.

25
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.410
From the top, we see several files with data,

26
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.670
and below, is their description.

27
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.835
Sometimes in addition to data issued by organizers,

28
00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:22.455
we can use other data.

29
00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:25.973
For example, in order to improve image classification model,

30
00:01:25.973 --> 00:01:28.965
one may use a publicly available data set of images.

31
00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:33.660
But this depends on a particular competition and you need to check the rules.

32
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.835
The next concept is a model.

33
00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:39.020
This is exactly what we will build during the competition.

34
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.645
It's better to think about model not as one specific algorithm,

35
00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:46.075
but something that transforms data into answers.

36
00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:48.300
The model should have two main properties.

37
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.150
It should produce best possible prediction and be reproducible.

38
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.240
In fact, it can be very complicated and contain a lot of algorithms,

39
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.070
handcrafted features, use a variety of libraries as

40
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.620
this model of the winners of the Homesite competition shown on this slide.

41
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.830
It's large and includes many components.

42
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.845
But in the course, we will learn how to build such models.

43
00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:11.260
To compare our model with the model of other participants,

44
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.330
we will send our predictions to the server or in other words, make the submission.

45
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.970
Usually, you're asked about predictions only.

46
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.680
Sources or models are not required.

47
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.115
And also there are some exceptions,

48
00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:26.045
cool competitions, where participants submit their code.

49
00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.570
In this course, we'll focus on

50
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.815
traditional challenges where a competitor submit only prediction outputs.

51
00:02:31.815 --> 00:02:35.290
Often, I can not just provide a so-called sample submission.

52
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.303
An example of how the submission file should look like,

53
00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:41.414
look at the sample submission from the Zillow competition.

54
00:02:41.414 --> 00:02:42.735
In it is the first column.

55
00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:48.090
We must specify the ID of the object and then specify our prediction for it.

56
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.345
This is typical format that is used in many competitions.

57
00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:54.745
Now, we move to the next concept, evaluation function.

58
00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:56.115
When you submit predictions,

59
00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:58.865
you need to know how good is your model.

60
00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:02.065
The quality of the model is defined by evaluation function.

61
00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:04.005
In essence and simply the function,

62
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.720
the text prediction and correct answers and

63
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.305
returns a score characterizes the performance of the solution.

64
00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:13.455
The simplest example of such a function is the accurate score.

65
00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:15.955
This is just a rate of correct answers.

66
00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:18.735
In general, there are a lot of such functions.

67
00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:22.230
In our course, we will carefully consider some of them.

68
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.820
The description of the competition always indicates which evaluation function is used.

69
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.620
I strongly suggest you to pay attention to

70
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.485
this function because it is what we will try to optimize.

71
00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:34.590
But often, we are not interested in the score itself.

72
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.180
We should only care about our relative performance in comparison to other competitors.

73
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.435
So we move to the last point we are considering, the leaderboard.

74
00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:44.880
The leaderboard is the rate which provides you with

75
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.140
information about performance of all participating teams.

76
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.375
Most machine learning competition platforms keep your submission history,

77
00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:55.405
but the leaderboard usually shows only your best score and position.

78
00:03:55.405 --> 00:03:57.000
They cannot as that submission score,

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.425
reveal some information about data set.

80
00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:01.015
And, in extreme cases,

81
00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:04.740
one can obtain ground truth targets after sending a lot of submissions.

82
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.341
In order to handle this,

83
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:09.750
the set is divided into two parts, public and private.

84
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.955
This split is hidden from users and during the competition,

85
00:04:12.955 --> 00:04:16.500
we see the score calculated only on public subset of the data.

86
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.540
The second part of data set is used for

87
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.465
private leaderboard which is revealed after the end of the competition.

88
00:04:22.465 --> 00:04:25.455
Only this second part is used for final rating.

89
00:04:25.455 --> 00:04:28.905
Therefore, a standard competition routine looks like that.

90
00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:31.840
You as the competition, you analyze the data, improve model,

91
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.085
prepare submission, send it, see leaderboard score.

92
00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:37.980
You repeat this action several times.

93
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.430
All this time, only public leaderboard is available.

94
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.338
By the end of the competition,

95
00:04:43.338 --> 00:04:46.505
you should select submissions which will be used for final scoring.

96
00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:49.770
Usually, you are allowed to select two final submissions.

97
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.705
Choose wisely. Sometimes public leaderboard scores might be misleading.

98
00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:55.490
After the competition deadline,

99
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.282
public leaderboard is revealed,

100
00:04:57.282 --> 00:04:59.350
and its used for the final rating and defining the winners.

101
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.350
That was a brief overview of competition mechanics.

102
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.810
Keep in mind that many concepts can be slightly different in a particular competition.

103
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.115
All details, for example,

104
00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:12.933
where they can join into teams or use external data,

105
00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:14.895
you will find in the rules.

106
00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:18.990
Strongly suggest you to read the rules carefully before joining the competition.

107
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.395
Now, I want to say a few words about competition platforms.

108
00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:25.220
Although Kaggle is the biggest and most famous one,

109
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.425
there is a number of smaller platforms or

110
00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:31.260
even single-competition sites like KDD and VizDooM.

111
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.440
Although this list will change over time,

112
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.835
I believe you will find the competition which is most relevant and interesting for you.

113
00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:42.950
Finally, I want to tell you about the reasons to participate in data science competition.

114
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.750
The main reason is that competition is a great opportunity for learning.

115
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.650
You communicate with other participants,

116
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.000
try new approaches and get a lot of experience.

117
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.855
Second reason is that competition often offer you

118
00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:58.340
non-trivial problems and state-of-the-art approaches.

119
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.960
It allows you to broaden the horizons and

120
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.120
look at some everyday task from a different point of view.

121
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.645
It's also a great way to become recognizable,

122
00:06:06.645 --> 00:06:11.695
get some kind of frame inside data science community and receive a nice job offer.

123
00:06:11.695 --> 00:06:15.690
The last reason to participate is that you have a chance for winning some money.

124
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.924
It shouldn't be the main goal,

125
00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:18.300
just a pleasant bonus.

126
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.080
In this video, we analyzed the basic concept of the competition,

127
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.270
talked about platforms and reasons for participation.

128
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.500
In the next video, we will talk about the difference between real life and competitions.
