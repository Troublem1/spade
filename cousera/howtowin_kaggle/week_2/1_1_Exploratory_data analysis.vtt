00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.743
Hi, in this lesson we
will talk about the very

3
00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:11.910
first steps a good data scientist
takes when he is given a new data set.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.767
Mainly, exploratory data analysis or
EDA in short.

5
00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:20.280
By the end of this lesson, you will know,
what are the most important things from

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.850
data understanding and exploration
prospective we need to pay attention to.

7
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.580
This knowledge is required
to build good models and

8
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.808
achieve high places on the leader board.

9
00:00:29.808 --> 00:00:35.400
We will first discuss what exploratory
data analysis is and why we need it.

10
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.150
We will then go through important
parts of EDA process and

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.190
see examples of what we
can discover during EDA.

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.682
Next we will take a look at the tools
we have to perform exploration.

13
00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:50.506
What plots to draw and
what functions from pandas and

14
00:00:50.506 --> 00:00:53.820
matplotlib libraries can be useful for us.

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.840
We will also briefly discuss a very
basic data set cleaning process

16
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.570
that is convenient to perform
while exploring the data.

17
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.460
And finally we'll go through
exploration process for

18
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.300
the Springleaf competition
hosted on Kaggle some time ago.

19
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.000
In this video we'll start talking
about Exploratory Data Analysis.

20
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.890
What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

21
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.550
It's basically a process of looking
into the data, understanding it and

22
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.600
getting comfortable with it.

23
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.874
Getting comfortable with a task,
probably always the first thing you do.

24
00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:28.828
To solve a problem,
you need to understand a problem,

25
00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:31.820
and to know what you
are given to solve it.

26
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.600
In data science, complete data
understanding is required to generate

27
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.160
powerful features and
to build accurate models.

28
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.535
In fact while you explore the data,
you build an intuition about it.

29
00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:45.624
And when the data is intuitive for you,

30
00:01:45.624 --> 00:01:48.856
you can generate hypothesis
about possible new features and

31
00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:53.250
eventually find some insights in the data
which in turn can lead to a better score.

32
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.080
We will see the example of what EDA
can give us later in this lesson.

33
00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:02.900
Well, one may argue that
there is another way to go.

34
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.140
Read the data from the hard drive,
never look at it and

35
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.270
feed the classifier immediately.They use
some pretty advanced modeling techniques,

36
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.980
like mixing, stacking, and eventually get
a pretty good score on the leaderboard.

37
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.190
Although this approach sometimes works,

38
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.070
it cannot take you to the very
top positions and let you win.

39
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.320
Top solutions always use advanced and
aggressive modeling.

40
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.170
But usually they have
something more than that.

41
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.040
They incorporated insights from the data,
and

42
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.850
to find those insights,
they did a careful EDA.

43
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.150
While we need to admit the raw
computations where all you can do is

44
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.400
modeling and EDA will not help
you to build a better model.

45
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.280
It is usually the case when
the data is anonymized,

46
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.006
encrypted, pre-processed, and obfuscated.

47
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:53.390
But look it will any way need to perform
EDA to realize that this is the case and

48
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.000
you better spend more time on modeling and
make a server busy for a month.

49
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.080
One of the main EDA
tools is Visualization.

50
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.160
When we visualize the data,
we immediately see the patterns.

51
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.110
And with this, ask ourselves,
what are those patterns?

52
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.080
Why do we see them?

53
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.395
And finally, how do we use those
patters to build a better model?

54
00:03:13.395 --> 00:03:17.130
It also can be another way around.

55
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.830
Maybe we come up with a particular
hypothesis about the data.

56
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.390
What do we do?

57
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.900
We test it by making a visualization.

58
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.690
In one of the next videos,

59
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.380
we'll talk about the main visualization
tools we can use for exploration.

60
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.559
Just as a motivation example,
I want to tell you about the competition,

61
00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:40.420
alexander D'yakonov, a former top one
at Kagel took part some time ago.

62
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.780
The interesting thing about this
competition is that you do not need

63
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.990
to do any modeling,
if you understood your data well.

64
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.820
In that competition,
the objective was to predict

65
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.670
whether a person will use the promo
that a company offers him.

66
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.200
So each role correspond to a particular
promo received by a person.

67
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.430
There are features that
describe the person, for

68
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.400
example his age, sex,
is he married or not and so on.

69
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.420
And there are features that describe
the promo, the target is 0 or

70
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.760
1, will he use the promo or not.

71
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.390
But, among all the features there
were two especially interesting.

72
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.540
The first one is, the number of
promos sent by the person before.

73
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.800
And the second is the number of
promos the person had to use before.

74
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.850
So let's take a particular user,
say with index 13,

75
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.790
and sort the rows by number
of promos sent column.

76
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.210
And now let's take a look
at the difference at column

77
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.850
the number of used promos
between two consecutive rows.

78
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.650
It is written here in diff column.

79
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.090
And look, the values in diff column in
most cases equal the target values.

80
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.900
And in fact, there is no magic.

81
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.550
Just think about
the meaning of the columns.

82
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.560
For example, for the second row we see
that the person used one promo already but

83
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.900
he was sent only one before that time.

84
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.010
And that is why we know that he used the
first promo and thus we have an answer for

85
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.710
the first row.

86
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.568
In general, if before the current
promo the person used n promos and

87
00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:20.088
before the next promo he used that,

88
00:05:20.088 --> 00:05:25.722
we know that he used n + 1 promos then we
realize that he used the current promo.

89
00:05:25.722 --> 00:05:27.980
And so the answer is 1.

90
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.710
If we know that he used n
promos before the next promo,

91
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.860
exactly as before the current promo,

92
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.680
then obviously he did not use
the current promo and the answer is 0.

93
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.020
Well, it's not clear what
to do with the last row for

94
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.360
every user, or when we have missing rows,
but you see the point.

95
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.210
We didn't even run the classifier,
and we have 80% accuracy already.

96
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.130
This would not be possible if we didn't
do an EDA and didn't look into the data.

97
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.290
Also as a remark, I should say
that the presented method works

98
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.620
because of mistake made by
the organizers during data preparation.

99
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.750
These mistakes are called leaks, and

100
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.520
in competitions we are usually
allowed to exploit them.

101
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.540
We'll see more of these
examples later in this course.

102
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.770
So in this video we discussed the main
reasons for performing an EDA.

103
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.520
That is to get comfortable with the data
and to find insights in magic features.

104
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.140
We also saw an example where EDA and

105
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.970
the data understanding was
important to get a better score.

106
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.156
And finally, the point to take away.

107
00:06:36.156 --> 00:06:40.324
When you start a competition,
you better start with EDA, and

108
00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:42.420
not with hardcore modelling.

109
00:06:43.665 --> 00:06:46.005
We've had a lot of things to
talk about in this lesson.

110
00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:48.463
So letÂ´s move to the next video.

111
00:06:48.463 --> 00:06:58.463
