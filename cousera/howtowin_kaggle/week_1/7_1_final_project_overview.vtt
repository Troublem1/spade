Hello, everyone. In this video,

2
00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:08.550
we will talk a little bit about the main assignment of this course,

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.880
the competition, which plays the role of the final project.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.800
Now, let's briefly discuss the data.

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.860
For more details, see the competition web page on Kaggle.

6
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.880
The data in this competition is quite challenging.

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.400
You can work with a time series data set consisting of daily sales data,

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.153
kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software company.

9
00:00:30.153 --> 00:00:31.975
It's called 1C.

10
00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:35.860
The training data consists of records with information that

11
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.550
a particular item had been sold in a particular shop,

12
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.560
in a particular day, in the training period.

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.630
The task is to forecast the sales for every item in every shop in the testing period.

14
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.952
There are about 6 million such records in the training set,

15
00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:57.430
collected over 30 shops selling 20,000 unique items.

16
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.770
But don't be afraid of these numbers.

17
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.580
This is the moderate-sized competition data set nowadays.

18
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.150
The training period is about one and a half year,

19
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.515
and the testing period is the month that falls on training period.

20
00:01:11.515 --> 00:01:14.500
Note that you provide these daily sales in training period.

21
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.370
Well, you need to predict aggregated sales for testing period.

22
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.055
That is, you need to predict monthly sales for every possible shop item pair.

23
00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:27.382
In fact, correct aggregation of

24
00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:32.880
overall daily sales and generation of appropriate features is a part of this challenge.

25
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.632
As in the majority of competitions,

26
00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:38.945
that this data is split into public and private parts.

27
00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:42.975
You can submit your test predictions up to five times every day on

28
00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:45.790
Kaggle platform and up to five times every

29
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.105
week to Coursera's programming assignment grader.

30
00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:54.885
Kaggle will evaluate the quality of your predictions on the public part of test set,

31
00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:57.825
while Coursera's grader will report quality,

32
00:01:57.825 --> 00:02:00.730
both in public and private parts.

33
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.390
That is, you can rarely peek at your private score.

34
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.295
Remember, the earlier you start working on the competition,

35
00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:11.500
the more private score feedback you can get.

36
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.915
We encourage you to get familiar with the data

37
00:02:13.915 --> 00:02:17.105
right away and not to wait until the very end.

38
00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:22.160
Start simple and then improve your solution every week.

39
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.830
Remember, your final grades will depend on how would you have performed on

40
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.135
the private part of the leaderboard and on the quality of your solution report,

41
00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:34.550
which will be graded by your peers.

42
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.050
You can read more about this in the reading material in the end of this week.

43
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.290
And, finally, the goal of the competition is to learn as much as possible,

44
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.370
so we strongly encourage you to participate in teams.

45
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.740
It is always fun and engaging.

46
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.005
In teams, you can discuss ideas and get feedback.

47
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.842
You can share a code and learn new tricks,

48
00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:59.380
and you can get help if you're stuck.

49
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.523
If you don't have any teammates yet,

50
00:03:01.523 --> 00:03:04.845
you can find them and meet them on forums.

51
00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:09.030
Please never, never share your code on forums,

52
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.240
neither on Coursera forums,

53
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.195
nor on Kaggle's forums.

54
00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:16.810
Sharing codes outside of the teams is strictly forbidden.

55
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.925
You are encouraged to share and discuss interesting ideas,

56
00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:23.750
thoughts, even small quote snippets held by the learners,

57
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.950
but do not even share the complete code for your solution

58
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.560
because many people will blindly copy

59
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.930
paste your code without even trying to understand it.

60
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.960
It will reduce quality of skills acquired by fellow students,

61
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.255
it will ruin the fun of the fair competition.

62
00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:44.175
On the other hand, every time you're stuck,

63
00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:48.335
go in forums, and you will definitely find some inspiration there.

64
00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:53.560
Good luck with the project and have fun.
