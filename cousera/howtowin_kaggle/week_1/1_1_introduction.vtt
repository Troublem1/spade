00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:07.250
Hello, and welcome.

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.170
My name is Dimitri, and

4
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.060
I'm happy to see you are interested
in competitive data science.

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.710
Data science is all about
machine learning applications.

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.640
And in data science, like everywhere else,
people are looking for

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.380
the very best solutions to their problems.

8
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.240
They're looking for the models that
have the best predictive capabilities,

9
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.850
the models that make as
few mistakes as possible.

10
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.830
And the competition for one becomes
an essential way to find such solutions.

11
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.340
Competing for the prize,
participants push through the limits,

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.680
come up with novel ideas.

13
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.250
Companies organize data science
competitions to get top quality models for

14
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.940
not so high price.

15
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.980
And for data scientists,
competitions become a truly unique

16
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.215
opportunity to learn, well,
and of course win a prize.

17
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.090
This course is a chance for you to catch
up on the trends in competitive data

18
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.060
science and learn what we,
competition addicts and at the same time,

19
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.239
lecturers of this course,
have already learned while competing.

20
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.976
In this course, we will go through
competition solving process step by

21
00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:09.982
step and tell you about exploratory data
analysis, basic and advanced feature

22
00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:13.712
generation and preprocessing,
various model validation techniques.

23
00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:18.498
Data leakages, competition's metric
optimization, model ensembling,

24
00:01:18.498 --> 00:01:20.370
and hyperparameter tuning.

25
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.050
We've put together all our experience and
created this course for you.

26
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.520
We've also designed quizzes and

27
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.000
programming assignments to let you
apply your newly acquired skills.

28
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.570
Moreover, as a final project, you will
have an opportunity to compete with

29
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.545
other students and
participate in a special competition,

30
00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:43.460
hosted on the world's largest platform for
data science challenges called Kaggle.

31
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.354
Now, let's meet other lecturers and
get started.
